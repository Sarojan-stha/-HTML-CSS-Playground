# -HTML-CSS-Playground
🚀 My space for hands-on practice with HTML &amp; CSS — exploring layouts, styling, and frontend basics.

## Welcome to my personal HTML and CSS playground!  
This is where I practice and experiment with the building blocks of the web — from basic layouts to creative styling.

## 🛠️ What you'll find here:
- Mini projects and components (buttons, forms, cards, etc.)
- Responsive layout experiments
- Styling tricks and effects

## 🚀 Why this repo?
I'm currently learning web development, and this space helps me apply what I learn by building small, focused examples. It also tracks my progress publicly as I grow.
